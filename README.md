# The Project

This project is a sprint, dash and shake camera mechanic made with Unreal Engine C++, with a character that shake the camera during the sprint and can do a dash.

# Reference

My biggest reference was the AAA franchise Gears of War, which uses this system a lot.

# Objective
This functionality was made for my portfolio and to grow my programming skills.

Also, if you want to use this project for study, make money, etc., it's okay! Use it as you wish!

# How was done?

1.0 - First of all, I've created some variables and functions to do the logic.

2.0 - After that, I changed some default values of my movement and camera. And then modified the values of all variables created.

2.1 - So, I made the Bind Actions of sprint and dash.

2.2 - And started to make the logic. First I checked the sprint to know when I'm sprinting and if I'm doing this the shaking camera will appear.

2.3 - About shaking the camera, I've just created a class that has the camera shake asset like her father. And then, I've made some modifications to appear the camera shake 
effect.

2.4 - About the dash, I've made a logic to know if I'm dashing and a cooldown for the player don't use it all the time.

3.0 - For the finish, I opened the Animation Blueprint, passed some values to local variables, and constructed the Anim Graph.
